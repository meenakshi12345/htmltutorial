	 <p class="social" style="width:1200px">Facebook is a social networking service launched on February 4, 2004. It was founded by Mark Zuckerberg with his college roommates and fellow Harvard University student Eduardo Saverin.
		 [1] The website's membership was initially limited by the founders to Harvard students, 
		 but was expanded to other colleges in the Boston area, the Ivy League,
		 [2] and gradually most universities in the United States and Canada,
		 [3][4] corporations,[5] and by September 2006, 
		 to everyone with a valid email address along with an age requirement of being 13 and older.
